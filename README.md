# Flickr Wallpaper Generator

This app doesn't generate wallpaper yet! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
This only downloads a flickr image based on the current weather conditions and time of day. Feel free to modify it and add features :smiley:

## Getting Started

1. You need weather api found [here](https://code.google.com/p/python-weather-api/)

2. Flickr api is included and you need to get your own `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` from [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/) and change the values.


#### Notes

I have added only Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai yahoo location codes. You can add your own location codes. 

The code only supports Indian locations. I'll update the code for world cities also in the near future.

Have fun!
